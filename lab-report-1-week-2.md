## Part 5: Moving Files With Scp
* Create a file on your computer called WhereAmI.java and put the following contents into it:

` class WhereAmI {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("os.name"));
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.name"));
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.home"));
    System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.dir"));
  }
}`
* Compiled and ran the file on VS Code

* Then ran `scp WhereAmI.java cs15lwi22ags@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/` to copy this file to the remote server

## Part 6: SSH Key
* This created two new files on your system; the private key (in a file id_rsa) and the public key (in a file id_rsa.pub), stored in the .ssh directory on your computer.
* Follow up the following commands to set your keys

`$ ssh cs15lwi22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu`

`<Enter Password>`

`# now on server`

`$ mkdir .ssh`

`$ <logout>`

`# back on client`

`$ scp /Users/joe/.ssh/id_rsa.pub cs15lwi22@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

`# You use your username and the path you saw in the command above `

* After your password is all set, you can login without entering the password

## Part 7 â€“ Making Remote Running Even More Pleasant
* You can write a command in quotes at the end of an ssh command to directly run it on the remote server, then exit.
* Like the following:
